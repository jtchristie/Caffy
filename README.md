# Caffy
 SwiftUI app that uses the Google Places API to find Cafes near you
 
 This app is built fully in SwiftUI
 
 It also has full user authentication including signing up, signing in, signing out and deleting accounts through the use of Firebase Authentication
 
 The MapView is styled using Google Maps Tile Overlay which I adapted for SwiftUI
